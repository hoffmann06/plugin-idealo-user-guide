For further information about idealo.de, refer to the [Setting up idealo Checkout in plentymarkets](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/omni-channel/multi-channel/idealo-checkout/idealo-setup) page of the manual. In order to set up the plugin for idealo.de, first register as seller.

## 2 Setting up the data format IdealoDE-Plugin in plentymarkets

→ **Note**: Not all of the columns of idealo's product CSV are available in plentymarkets at present. Check whether you need columns which are not yet available in plentymarkets prior to setting up idealo in plentymarkets. In this case, an integration of idealo is currently not possible.<br/> An overview of the columns which are available in plentymarkets can be found in the chapter **Available columns for the export file**.

By installing this plugin you will receive the export format **IdealoDE-Plugin**. Use this format to exchange data between plentymarkets and idealo.de. It is required to install the Plugin **Elastic export** from the plentyMarketplace first before you can use the format **IdealoDE-Plugin** in plentymarkets.

Once both plugins are installed, you can create the export format **IdealoDE-Plugin**. Refer to the [Elastic Export](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/basics/data-exchange/elastic-export) page of the manual for further details about the individual format settings.

Creating a new export format:

1. Go to **Data » Elastic export**.
2. Click on **New export**.
3. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in table 1.
4. **Save** the settings. 
→ The export format will be given an ID and it will appear in the overview within the **Exports** tab.

The following table lists details for settings, format settings and recommended item filters for the format **IdealoDE-Plugin**.
